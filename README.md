![Instacart mobile app screens](images/Instacart.png)

**Instacart** is the leading grocery technology company in North America, partnering with more than 1,400 national, regional, and local retail banners to deliver from more than 80,000 stores across more than 14,000 cities in North America.

## Project Description
The primary aim of the project is to uncover patterns in the purchasing habits of Instacart's shoppers based on their 
and find every conceivable insight that can contribute to the further business growth.
  
**Main questions to answer:**
- What shopper behaviour is at different hours of the day? days of the week?
- How often and when are products from different department/aisle sold?
- How many days pass before people place another order?
- How many items do people buy?
- Which items are the best-sellers?
- Which items are most frequently reordered?
- Which items are added to the cart first? second? third?
- What is a shopper profile?

**Project goals:**
1. Extract data from the data source.
2. Load data to SQL database.
3. Provide answers to the main business questions, using:
   + (a) SQL queries, or
   + (b) Jupyter notebook & Python code.

## Dataset Overview
### Source
“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, accessed from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data.
### Dataset structure
This anonymized dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.
Most of the files and variable names should be self-explanatory.

The dataset is a relational set of **7 files** describing customers' orders over time:
* products.csv
* aisles.csv
* departments.csv
* orders.csv
* order_products__SET (see **SET** described below)

#### Key data descriptions
* order_id: order identifier
* user_id: customer identifier
* eval_set: which evaluation set this order belongs in (see **SET** described below)
* order_number: the order sequence number for this user (1 = first, n = nth)
* order_dow: the day of the week the order was placed on
* order_hour_of_day: the hour of the day the order was placed on
* days_since_prior: days since the last order, capped at 30 (with NAs for order_number = 1)
* add_to_cart_order: order in which each product was added to cart 
* reordered: 1 if this product has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise

SET is one of the four following evaluation sets (eval_set in orders):
* "prior": orders prior to that users most recent order (~3.2m orders)
* "train": training data supplied to participants (~131k orders)
* "test": test data reserved for machine learning competitions (~75k orders)

In the 'orders' table, "train" and "test" identify the last order for every user, and are randomly split between train and test.
They are "future data", but only on a per-user basis (e.g., the last order for user X might be earlier than the first order for user Y).

**NOTE**: This dataset includes orders from many different retailers and is **a heavily biased subset** of Instacart’s production data.
And so it is not a representative sample of its products, users or their purchasing behavior.

## Findings & Conclusions

**Peak Ordering Times:** The majority of grocery orders are placed between 8:00 and 19:00, with the highest volume occurring between 10:00 and 16:00. 
There is no distinct rush hour, reflecting natural daytime shopping patterns.

**Weekly Shopping Trends:** Users show increased activity from Sunday afternoon to Monday afternoon, likely stocking up after the weekend. 
Days 0 (Sunday) and 1 (Monday) are the most popular for shopping, while Saturday sees fewer orders due to potential housekeeping and outdoor activities.

**Stable Midweek Ordering:** From Tuesday to Friday, order volumes remain stable between 9:00 and 16:00, with a slight dip around lunchtime, likely due to lunch breaks.

**Order Size:** The median number of products per order is 8, with 75% of orders containing fewer than 14 products. Typical orders have up to 27 products, while orders with 28 to 145 products are considered atypical.

**Re-order Frequency:** Users typically reorder every 7 days, with a maximum interval of 30 days. The minimum re-order interval is often skewed by NaN values, but subsequent data suggest a minimum of 1 day.

**Re-order Patterns:**

* **Initial Orders:** Average 10 products, with a maximum of 17.
* **Re-orders within 6 Days:** Average 9 to 14 products, with a maximum of 27. 
* **Re-orders after 7 Days:** Average 15 products, with a maximum of 30.

**Popular Re-ordered Products:** Fresh fruits, vegetables, milk, and water are frequently reordered. Items like yogurt, soy lactose-free products, bread, eggs, and cheese have high re-order frequencies but are purchased in smaller quantities.

**Fruits vs. Vegetables:** Fruits are reordered more frequently than vegetables due to their shorter shelf life, versatility in consumption, and consumer preferences. In contrast, spices, seasonings, and baking ingredients are least likely to be reordered.

**Top-Selling and Re-ordered Products:** The top-selling products are fresh fruits, vegetables, and organic whole milk, reflecting health-conscious customers. 
Bananas are the top-selling product, followed by strawberries, avocados, spinach, and lemons. These items are also the most frequently re-ordered, indicating their status as staples.

**Product Tiers:**

* Tier 1: Highly likely to be purchased items like bananas, strawberries, avocados, spinach, whole milk, raspberries, lemons, and limes. 
* Tier 2: Frequently ordered products such as Fuji apples, cucumbers, blueberries, yellow onions, and half & half. 
* Tier 3: Products with fewer orders, including soda, reduced-fat milk, Hass avocados, garlic, and Honeycrisp apples.

**Top Departments Dominance:** The produce department and dairy eggs department collectively account for nearly 46% of all orders, making them the top-priority departments with the best-selling and frequently reordered products.

**Sales Concentration:** Together with snacks, beverages, frozen, and pantry goods (Group 2), these departments generate 76% of all sales. 
This highlights the importance of focusing on these categories for further investigation and optimization.

**Aisle Insights:** The most common aisles belong to produce and dairy eggs, while certain smaller or niche departments like bakery, deli, and breakfast also feature popular aisles. 
The pantry department is more fragmented, with less frequently purchased items like baking ingredients and seasonings.

### Recommendations:

**Prominent Display:** Prioritize displaying these essential products prominently when users log in or visit the site. 

**Promotional Strategies:** Offer bundle deals and recommend related products to increase the average order value.

**Inventory Management:**
* **Stock Management:** Ensure the consistent availability of top-selling and frequently re-ordered products to maintain customer satisfaction and a smooth supply chain. 
* **Focus on Top Departments:** Ensure continuous availability and optimal stock levels for produce and dairy eggs, as these departments account for nearly 46% of orders. Regularly monitor inventory to prevent stockouts of high-demand items. 
* **Expand High-Performing Aisles:** Prioritize restocking and expanding popular aisles within the produce and dairy eggs departments. Consider increasing the variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and dairy products to meet customer demand.

**Enhance Product Visibility:**
* **Promote High-Sales Departments:** Highlight products from top departments (produce and dairy eggs) on the homepage and in marketing campaigns to drive sales. Utilize advertising banners and product recommendations to promote these items. 
* **Feature Popular Aisles:** Create dedicated sections on the platform for popular aisles from smaller or niche departments (e.g., bakery, deli, breakfast) to increase their visibility and encourage purchases.

**Targeted Marketing and Promotions:**
* **Bundle Deals:** Offer bundle deals and discounts on frequently reordered items to increase average order value. For example, create bundles that include staple items like bananas, strawberries, and spinach with complementary products.
* **Customer Retention Strategies:** Implement loyalty programs or subscription services for high-demand categories (e.g., produce and dairy) to encourage repeat purchases and improve customer retention.

**Segmented Marketing Campaigns:** Develop targeted marketing campaigns for different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. 
For example, promote health-focused products to health-conscious customers and convenience items to busy professionals.

**Improve Pantry Department Offerings:**
* **Streamline Product Range:** Evaluate the extensive selection of pantry items and identify low-performing products. Focus on stocking high-demand items and consolidating less popular ones to streamline the inventory.
* **Enhance Product Information:** Provide detailed product descriptions, usage tips, and recipe ideas for pantry items to increase their appeal and drive sales. Highlight the versatility and benefits of these products to attract more customers.
